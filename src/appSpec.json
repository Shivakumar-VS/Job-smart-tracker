        "designSummary": "This brand design embraces a modern, minimalistic aesthetic characterized by a fresh and airy color palette dominated by pastel greens and deep charcoal tones. The layout is modular and spacious, featuring rounded corners and generous padding that create a soft, approachable interface. Typography is clean and geometric, likely using a sans-serif font such as 'rubik-v2' or 'work-sans-v2', supporting clarity and readability. The navigation bar is distinct with a pill-shaped background in a light pastel green, enhancing usability and visual separation. Interactive elements like buttons and icons are minimal and subtle, with the bright lime green 'brandAccent' color used sparingly to draw attention to calls-to-action such as the WhatsApp icon. Overall, the design conveys a professional, trustworthy, and innovative brand personality, suitable for technology or home product industries focused on quality and user experience.",

    "designSummary": "This brand design embraces a modern, minimalistic aesthetic characterized by a fresh and airy color palette dominated by pastel greens and deep charcoal tones. The layout is modular and spacious, featuring rounded corners and generous padding that create a soft, approachable interface. Typography is clean and geometric, likely using a sans-serif font such as 'rubik-v2' or 'work-sans-v2', supporting clarity and readability. The navigation bar is distinct with a pill-shaped background in a light pastel green, enhancing usability and visual separation. Interactive elements like buttons and icons are minimal and subtle, with the bright lime green 'brandAccent' color used sparingly to draw attention to calls-to-action such as the WhatsApp icon. Overall, the design conveys a professional, trustworthy, and innovative brand personality, suitable for technology or home product industries focused on quality and user experience.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' color as the main accent for calls-to-action and highlights, paired with 'primaryForeground' for text and icons to ensure strong contrast. The 'secondary' color serves as the primary dark background or text color, with 'secondaryForeground' used for text on dark backgrounds to maintain readability. The 'background' color provides a soft, fresh base for the overall site, creating an airy and clean atmosphere. 'brandAccent' is used for secondary highlights and to differentiate content blocks, while 'subtleBackground' supports layering and subtle section separation. Colors should be combined thoughtfully to maintain accessibility and visual hierarchy, ensuring that text and interactive elements always have sufficient contrast against their backgrounds.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primary' color paired with 'primaryForeground' meets WCAG AA standards for text and UI elements, providing clear visibility. The 'secondary' and 'secondaryForeground' combination also meets WCAG AA contrast ratios, suitable for large and small text. Background colors like 'background', 'brandAccent', and 'subtleBackground' are used primarily for large areas and should be paired with appropriate foreground colors to maintain accessibility. Overall, the palette supports strong contrast and readability across different UI components."
